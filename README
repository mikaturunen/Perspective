I wanted to get rid of dependencies to glu when working with OpenGL. gluPerspective was the only function I used from the whole glu-library so I replaced it with this. 

Aims to do the same as gluPerspective and this way get rid of glu-library dependencies completely. Assuming the gluPerspective is the only glu library you are using.

Obviously depends on GL.h and OpenGL libraries to use it successfully, but this is just an example of SetPerspective function for OpengL.
